# fastly-exporter [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/peterbourgon/fastly-exporter.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/peterbourgon/fastly-exporter/releases/latest) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Factions-badge.atrox.dev%2Fpeterbourgon%2Ffastly-exporter%2Fbadge%3Fref%3Dmain&style=flat-square)](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/peterbourgon/fastly-exporter/goto?ref=main)

This program consumes from the [Fastly Real-time Analytics API][rt] and makes
the data available to [Prometheus][prom]. It should behave like you expect:
dynamically adding new services, removing old services, and reflecting changes
to service metadata like name and version.

```

### Source

If you have a working Go installation, you can clone the repo and install the
binary from any revision, including HEAD.

```
git clone git@github.com:peterbourgon/fastly-exporter
cd fastly-exporter
go build ./cmd/fastly-exporter
./fastly-exporter -h
```

## Using

### Basic

For simple use cases, all you need is a Fastly API token. [See this link][token]
for information on creating API tokens. The token can be provided via the
`-token` flag or the `FASTLY_API_TOKEN` environment variable.

[token]: https://docs.fastly.com/guides/account-management-and-security/using-api-tokens#creating-api-tokens

```
fastly-exporter -token XXX
```

This will collect real-time stats for all Fastly services visible to your token,
and make them available as Prometheus metrics on [127.0.0.1:8080/metrics][local].

[local]: http://127.0.0.1:8080/metrics

### Filtering services

By default, all services available to your token will be exported. You can
specify an explicit set of service IDs to export by using the `-service xxx`
flag. (Service IDs are available at the top of your [Fastly dashboard][db].) You
can also include only those services whose name matches a regex by using the
`-service-allowlist '^Production'` flag, or elide any service whose name matches
a regex by using the `-service-blocklist '.*TEST.*'` flag.

[db]: https://manage.fastly.com/services/all

For tokens with access to a lot of services, it's possible to "shard" the
services among different fastly-exporter instances by using the `-service-shard`
flag. For example, to shard all services between 3 exporters, you would start
each exporter as

```
fastly-exporter [common flags] -service-shard 1/3
fastly-exporter [common flags] -service-shard 2/3
fastly-exporter [common flags] -service-shard 3/3
```

### Filtering metrics

By default, all metrics provided by the Fastly real-time stats API are exported
as Prometheus metrics. You can export only those metrics whose name matches a
regex by using the `-metric-allowlist 'bytes_total$'` flag, or elide any metric
whose name matches a regex by using the `-metric-blocklist imgopto` flag.

### Filter semantics

All flags that filter services or metrics are repeatable. Repeating the same
flag causes its condition to be combined with OR semantics. For example,
`-service A -service B` would include both services A and B (but not service C).
Or, `-service-blocklist Test -service-blocklist Staging` would skip any service
whose name contained Test or Staging.

Different flags (for the same filter target) combine with AND semantics. For
example, `-metric-allowlist 'bytes_total$' -metric-blocklist imgopto` would only
export metrics whose names ended in bytes_total, but didn't include imgopto.

### Service discovery

Per-service metrics are available via `/metrics?target=<service ID>`. Available
services are enumerated as targets via the `/sd` endpoint, which is compatible
with the [generic HTTP service discovery][httpsd] feature of Prometheus. An
example Prometheus scrape config for the Fastly exporter follows.

[httpsq]: https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#http_sd_config

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: fastly
    http_sd_configs:
      - url: http://127.0.0.1:8080/sd
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: service
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: 127.0.0.1:8080
```
